There are several more tags within the <body /> container. Add this new code to your index.html file and save it. Then, open the file by navigating to it and double-clicking it. Now you have a simple static webpage open in your browser, built from scratch. It's not super exciting yet, but that's okay. It's the innards of the page we're focusing on right now.
